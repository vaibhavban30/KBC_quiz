This game is developed in C language using its fundamentals and logics.
It is based on the television show 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' aired every year.
A complete description of this game is as follows:
The KBC QUIZ GAME starts with a welcome page.
It is basically divided into two rounds. The first round is the “TRIPLE TEST ROUND” which consists of three questions and second round is the most important round, “THE HOTSEAT ROUND” which consists of 15 questions plus a “JACKPOT QUESTION”.
After welcome page there is an instruction page for the Triple Test round. A player must answer all three questions of Triple Test correctly to become eligible for the hotseat round. If a player fails to answer any question of Triple Test, he/she is not eligible for Hotseat round.
After clearing the Tripple Test, instructions for Hotseat rounds are displayed on the console.
If a player answers all the fifteen questions correctly for the amount Rs.1000 to Rs.20000000, he/she is eligible for jackpot questions for Rs.70000000 and if answered correctly, we have our new “CROREPATI” with us.
A player can quit the game anytime if he/she doesn’t know the answer. He/she will takeway the amount for last answered question correctly.
The most important thing about the quiz is the “PADAAV RULE”. There are two padaav’s in the game, first at 5th question for the amount of Rs.16000 and second at the 10th question for the amount of Rs.512000.
If player answer’s incorrectly between question no. 1 to 5, he/she is not eligible for any amount of money.
If player answer’s incorrectly between question no. 6 to 10, he/she falls down to amount of Rs.16000, that is the first padaav.
If player answer’s incorrectly after 10th question, he/she falls down to the amount of Rs.512000, that is the second padaav.
